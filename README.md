# MUSIC-2D-NearField

This repository implements a 2D source localization method using the classical MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) algorithm under near-field conditions. A Uniform Linear Array (ULA) is used, and the steering vector is modeled via a second-order Taylor approximation to account for wavefront curvature, enabling accurate estimation of both Angle of Arrival and range.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Antenna Array: Uniform Linear Array (ULA)
- Localization: 2D (AoA + Range) in near-field
- Signal Model: Free-space, Line-of-Sight (LoS)
- Wavefront Modeling: Taylor expansion (2nd order)
- Output: MUSIC pseudo-spectrum over angle and range grid

## ðŸ“Œ Visualization

Below is an example of the MUSIC pseudo-spectrum for a 2D scenario:

The peaks in the spectrum correspond to the estimated positions (AoA, distance) of the sources.
## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The number of sources is estimated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
- Near-field effects are captured via second-order phase modeling.
- The array geometry and propagation model are configurable via `responsearray.m`.
